          <h3 class="title">Why I Want to Code</h3>
          <p>
            I started taking college courses in 2011 at an age older than the average college student. I was twenty-six. I had spent the last six years working in the restaurant industry and decided it was time to do something different. Some may wonder why I didn’t start college right after high school and the reason is simple. I didn’t know what I wanted to major in. There were so many things that I liked I couldn’t decide. You see, I worked with individuals that had college degrees that were pushing plates for a living. They didn’t like what they had majored in and now were paying off student loans at a place with no career opportunities they were interested in. I didn’t want this to happen to me, so I waited.
            <br><br>
            It didn’t really matter that I waited, though, as I started with psychology, moved to accounting, and then settled on information technology. The career outlook for psychology majors looked rather bleak. I decided I needed to develop a tangible skill, thus my move to accounting. It wasn’t until the spring of 2014 that I started to consider a career in technology.
            <br><br>
            One cheery day in May my cousin gave me a call and asked if I could help him build a website. I informed him that this wasn’t something I had done before. He didn’t seem to care about my lack of experience so I said yes. I fired up the Macbook Pro and googled, “How to build a website?”. I found a plethora of tutorials and articles explaining what to do. Knowing where to start was difficult but I picked something and moved forward. HTML seemed strange and CSS seemed impossible. I began to doubt whether it was really possible to center something in CSS. However, the challenge of figuring it out kept me going. I was hooked.
            <br><br>
            I loved the constant learning and progression. HTML and CSS kept getting easier and I moved to more advanced topics in those categories, but something was missing. My website didn’t do much. Sure, it looked fine, but it just sat there.
            <br><br>
            Ultimately, 2014 was a pivotal year for me. I knew there were a lot of things I could be good at, but I discovered I had a passion for coding and the constant problem solving was addictive. Since that time, I have moved on to other topics in the development world. JS, jQuery, Angular, Ruby, and many more to come.
